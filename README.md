# EMF-Ears

This is my EMF Ears Gerber files.
I've made the layout from the schematic of a Makezine article :

https://makezine.com/projects/weekend-project-sample-weird-sounds-electromagnetic-fields/

To assemble the PCB you'll need :

- 2 x 22mH inductors
- 4 x 2.2uF capacitors
- 2 x 100uF capacitors
- 2 x 100k Ohm resistors
- 2 x 1k Ohm resistors
- 2 x 300k Ohm resistors
- 2 x 68k Ohm resistors
- a stereo jack socket (3F07 type one)
- a NE5532 OPamp or similar (OPA2134, LME49720, TL072, OPA1662 etc...)
- a stereo jack socket
- a 9v battery socket

have fun !
